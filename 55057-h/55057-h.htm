<h2>SEPTEMBER</h2>

<h3>FIRST YEAR</h3>

<h4>FIRST WEEK</h4>

<h5>Monday</h5>

<p>Show the children a sunflower. What is it? Who can think of
another flower of the same color? (Nasturtium, goldenrod, dandelion,
buttercup, etc.) Who can think of a flower that is blue? (Hyacinth,
bachelor&#8217;s button, flower de luce, etc.) Who can think of a
flower that is red? (Rose, carnation, geranium, poppy, etc.) Have each
child name some flower that he likes.</p>

<h5>Tuesday</h5>

<p>Allow the children to play &#8220;Hey, diddle, diddle.&#8221; One
child is the cat, another the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6"
id="Page_6">[6]</a></span> fiddle, a third the dish, others the spoon,
the little dog, the cow and the moon. All the rest of the children
repeat, very slowly:</p>

<div class="poetry">
  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
     <p>Hey, diddle, diddle,</p>
     <p>The cat and the fiddle.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>As the two lines are being recited, the children representing the
cat and the fiddle stand up at their seats and bow. As the words,</p>

<div class="poetry">
  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>The cow jumped over the moon,</p>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>are recited, the child representing the moon, stooping down,
holds out a round piece of pasteboard, a piece of paper, or anything
else that happens to be handy, even a book will serve, and the
&#8220;cow,&#8221; steps or jumps over it.</p>

<p>At the words,</p>

<div class="poetry">
  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>The little dog laughed to see such sport,</p>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>the little dog laughs. At</p>

<div class="poetry">
  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>The dish ran away with the spoon,</p>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>the two children representing dish and spoon take hold of hands and
run across the room.</p>

<p>Then other children may be selected for the various parts, and the
game may be played thus again and again.</p>

<h3>SECOND YEAR</h3>

<h4>FIRST WEEK</h4>

<h5>Monday</h5>

<p>Tell, or read, the following story, the children to guess what
animal is referred to.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Look what a small, shy thing I am! Do not frighten me, and I will
tell you all about myself. It is quite<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span> true that I come and nibble
your cheese and candles now and then. But if you will keep such nice
things stored away in heaps, how can I help longing for a taste? The
smell of your puddings and pie-crust is so nice! How should I know that
it belongs to you and not to me?</p>

<p>Please do not tell the cat where I am, or she will come and eat me
up. I do not like cats a bit. But there is something that I hate more
than cats, and that is the horrid traps you set to catch us in. When
one of my friends finds himself inside of one of these, you do not know
how badly he feels! How would you like it yourself?</p>

<p>We do some good in the world, though people fancy we do nothing but
harm. Men and women throw about bits or scraps of food enough to give
us many a nice meal. We run out and eat this, and leave the floor clean
and tidy.</p>

<p>We run off to our holes as quickly as can be if you frighten us, and
you will see no more of our soft fur and long tails. If you are kind we
shall be glad to make friends with you.&mdash;<i>Adapted.</i></p></div>

<h5>Tuesday</h5>

<p>Have the children tell, in their own words, the story of &#8220;The
Mouse.&#8221;</p>

<h5>Wednesday</h5>

<p>Copy the following:</p>

<div class="list">
<p>A mouse has gray fur.</p>
<p>A mouse has bright eyes.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span></p>

<h5>Thursday</h5>

<p>Have each child tell about some animal, the other children to guess
the animal meant. For example:</p>

<p>I have four legs. I have fur. When I am hungry I say,
&#8220;Miow.&#8221; When I am happy I purr. What am I?</p>

<p>If you find it to be too difficult for the children to give the
descriptions, you can describe the animals, and let all the children
guess what you are describing.</p>

<h5>Friday</h5>

<p>Write five words that rhyme with <i>cat</i>.</p>

<h4>SECOND WEEK</h4>

<h5>Monday</h5>

<p>What month is this? How many months are there in the year? How
many days in this month? Teach the rhyme, &#8220;Thirty days hath
September.&#8221;</p>

<h5>Tuesday</h5>

<p>Have the children write the names of the months.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13"
id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>

<h5>Wednesday</h5>

<p>Have the children complete the following sentences:</p>

<div class="list">
<p>Roses are &mdash;&mdash;.</p>

<p>Asters are &mdash;&mdash;.</p>

<p>Goldenrod is &mdash;&mdash;.</p>

<p>Lemons are &mdash;&mdash;.</p>

<p>Trees are &mdash;&mdash;.</p>

<p>My eyes are &mdash;&mdash;.</p>
</div>

<h5>Thursday</h5>

<p>To be memorized:</p>

<div class="poetry">
  <div class="poem">
    <p class="center">MY SHADOW</p>
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>I have a little shadow that goes in and out with me,</p>
      <p>And what can be the use of him is more than I can see.</p>
      <p>He is very, very like me from the heels up to the head;</p>
      <p>And I see him jump before me, when I jump into my bed.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>The funniest thing about him is the way he likes to grow&mdash;</p>
      <p>Not at all like proper children, which is always very slow;</p>
      <p>For he sometimes shoots up taller, like an Indian-rubber ball,</p>
      <p>And he sometimes gets so little that there&#8217;s none of him at all.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>He hasn&#8217;t got a notion of how children ought to play,</p>
      <p>And can only make a fool of me in every sort of way.</p><p class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></p>
      <p>He stays so close beside me, he&#8217;s a coward you can see;</p>
      <p>I&#8217;d think shame to stick to nursie as that shadow sticks to me!</p>
    </div>
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>One morning, very early, before the sun was up,</p>
      <p>I rose and found the shining dew on every buttercup;</p>
      <p>But my lazy little shadow, like an arrant sleepy-head,</p>
      <p>Had stayed at home behind me and was fast asleep in bed.</p>
      <p class="right">&mdash;<i>Robert Louis Stevenson.</i></p>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Have the children copy two stanzas of the poem.</p>

Shadow.&#8221;</p>

<h4>THIRD WEEK</h4>

<h5>Monday</h5>

<p>Teach the children the first stanza of &#8220;My Shadow.&#8221;</p>

<p>Who has a shadow? When can we see our shadow? How does the shadow
&#8220;Jump before me, when I jump into my bed&#8221;?</p>

<h5>Tuesday</h5>

<p>Teach the second stanza of &#8220;My Shadow.&#8221;</p>

<p>How does the shadow grow tall? How does it get &#8220;so
little&#8221;?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15"
id="Page_15">[15]</a></span></p>

<h5>Wednesday</h5>

<p>Teach the third stanza of &#8220;My Shadow,&#8221; questioning the

Shadow.&#8221;</p>

Shadow.&#8221;</p>

wrote yesterday.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16"
id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>

<h5>Friday</h5>

<p>Write five words that rhyme with <i>run</i>.</p>

taught here.</p>

<h3>THIRD YEAR</h3>

<h4>FIRST WEEK</h4>

<div class="poetry">
  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">

<h5>Wednesday</h5>

<p>Story for reproduction:</p>

<p class="center">JIM CROW</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>When Jim Crow became a member of our family he was very young, and
could hardly balance himself upon his slender legs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17"
id="Page_17">[17]</a></span></p>

<p>We fed him upon raw eggs and scraps of raw meat until he grew strong
and the black feathers had become smooth and glossy, and the bright
eyes were brighter, and Jim Crow had changed into a beautiful bird.</p>

<p>A smart bird was Jim, devoted to his master and mistress, hailing
them with a loud caw whenever their steps were heard, and hopping about
to greet them.</p>

<p>Jim could talk a little, and would have acquired much more knowledge
of the language if he had lived longer.</p>

<p>He would spread his wings, purple in their deep black, and call in a
hoarse voice, &#8220;Come on, come on,&#8221; very distinctly.</p>

<p>He would greet his master with &#8220;Hello, Papa,&#8221; and
delighted in feeding from his hand. He knew when the butcher boy came
with the meat, and was at the cook&#8217;s side when she received the
basket, croaking for his share.</p>

<p>Jim delighted in a plunge bath, and would splash away in an earthern
crock a dozen times a day, if it was filled for him.</p>

<p>He liked red and blue, and if ladies called at the house dressed in
these colors, the young crow would become frantic, spreading his wings
and tail, and crying, &#8220;Come on, Come on,&#8221; to the amusement
of all.</p>

<p>He would often eat corn with the chickens, and would act in a very
greedy way, filling his bill with the grain, rushing away and hiding
it, then coming back for more. If the chickens did not eat as fast as
they could, Jim had the lion&#8217;s share.</p>

<p>Jim was hurt one day by a stray dog, and then we didn&#8217;t have a
crow any more.&mdash;<i>Selected.</i></p>

Crow.&#8221;</p>

<p>Poem to be memorized:</p>

<div class="poetry">
  <div class="poem">
    <p>THE LAND OF STORY BOOKS</p>
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>At evening when the lamp is lit,</p>
      <p>Around the fire my parents sit;</p>
      <p>They sit at home, and talk and sing,</p>
      <p>And do not play at anything.</p>
          </div>
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>Now, with my little gun, I crawl</p>
      <p>All in the dark along the wall,</p>
      <p>And follow &#8217;round the forest track</p>
      <p>Away behind the sofa back.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>There, in the night, where none can spy,</p>
      <p>All in my hunter&#8217;s camp I lie</p>
      <p>And play at books that I have read</p>
      <p>Till it is time to go to bed.</p>
          </div>
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>These are the hills, these are the woods,</p>
      <p>These are my starry solitudes,</p>
      <p>And there the river, by whose brink</p>
      <p>The roaring lions come to drink.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
    </div>
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>I see the others far away,</p>
      <p>As if in firelit camp they lay,</p>
      <p>And I, like to an Indian scout,</p>
      <p>Around their party prowled about.</p>
          </div>
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>So when my nurse comes in for me,</p>

month follows October? What season is this? What season follows autumn?
What are the four seasons? How do you know that it is autumn? How is
the weather different from what it was in July? What are the birds
doing this month? What is happening to the leaves on the trees? What
flowers are in blossom this month?</p>

<div class="poetry">
  <div class="poem">
    <p class="center">LITTLE MISS CHESTNUT</p>
    <div class="stanza">
     <p>Little Miss Chestnut lived in a tree,</p>
     <p>She and her sisters; one, two, three.</p>
     <p>Their house was covered with prickles green,</p>
     <p>To keep the squirrels away, I ween.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="stanza">
     <p>Soon Jack Frost knocked, just for fun;</p>
     <p>Out jumped the chestnuts, every one.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="stanza">
     <p>Elsie and Fred, on their walk next day,</p>
     <p>Found the nuts and took them away.</p>
     <p>On winter evenings, cold and long,</p>
     <p>They&#8217;ll roast the nuts. Here ends my song.</p>
    </div>
    <p class="right">&mdash;<i>Selected</i></p>
  </div>
</div>

<p><em>Have ready</em>, but out of sight, a chestnut burr, if possible
containing some of the nuts. If you cannot get the burr, at least have
some of the nuts enough so that each child may have one to eat, after
the lesson is over.</p>

<p>Show the children how the prickly burr protects the nuts from
squirrels, and from boys and girls, until the nuts are ripe. Then Jack
Frost comes along and opens the burr, and the nuts fall out.</p>

<p>Explain how the nut itself is the seed of the chestnut tree, and
how, if allowed to lie under the snow all winter, a new little chestnut
tree will start up in the spring.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29"
id="Page_29">[29]</a></span></p>

<h5>Thursday</h5>

<p>Teach this little rhyme to the children:</p>

<div class="poetry">
  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
     <p>When we have a pleasant day,</p>
     <p>We like to stroll along the way;</p>
     <p>And as we walk upon the street,</p>
     <p>The folks we know we always greet.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Use the rhyme as a means of teaching the children the proper
method of salutation on the street. Let the girls wear their hats,
and the boys have their caps at their seats with them. Allow a boy
and a girl, with hats on, to go to the front of the room, and from
opposite sides of the room walk towards each other. As they start,
the children&mdash;all except the two at the front&mdash;repeat the
rhyme. When the two children at the front meet, the girl nods her head
politely, and the boy lifts his hat. After the simple ceremony the two
children return to their seats, and their places are taken by other
boys and girls, in turn, until all can perform the act easily and
gracefully.</p>

<h5>Friday</h5>

<p>Ask each child to bring a penny to school. See how many things are
to be found on the penny&mdash;as a head, date, etc.</p>

<h4>SECOND WEEK</h4>

<h5>Monday</h5>

<p>Tell the children that October was the month when America was
discovered. We live in the United States, and the United States is
in America. Tell the story of Columbus and the discovery of the new
continent. If well told, the story is quite as fascinating as a fairy
tale.</p>

<h5>Tuesday</h5>

<p>Have the children tell back to you the story of Columbus and the
discovery of America.</p>

<h5>Wednesday</h5>

<p>A poem dramatized.</p>

<p>This poem, acted out as indicated, can be used effectively as a rest
exercise. As all the children will be moving, the windows can be thrown
open, and the room aired while the game is being played.</p>

<p>The poem is to be recited by the teacher. Allow plenty of time
between lines, for each part to be acted.</p>

<p>Children representing Sunshine, Miss Weather and Professor Wind are
first chosen. They take their places in the front of the room.<span

<p>An October Pumpkin Story. (To be told to the children.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>One afternoon in late October, father went down to the field to get
a pumpkin.</p>

<p>The children went along too. They wanted to see that father picked
out a large pumpkin. They wanted to help bring it back to the house.</p>

<p>Although it was October, there were still some pumpkins to be found
in the field.</p>

<p>Father led the way. The children came trooping after.</p>

<p>The pumpkins grew down in the cornfield. Their long, coarse stems
lay sprawling on the ground. Their big, rough leaves looked like green
umbrellas.</p>

<p>The boys saw a very large pumpkin. They were just going to pick it,
but father said, &#8220;Not that one.&#8221;</p>

<p>Father looked around until he found a deep, yellow pumpkin. He told
the children that deep, yellow pumpkins make the best pies.</p>

<p>The children soon found another pumpkin, somewhat smoother than the
others. They picked that to use for a Jack-o&#8217;-lantern.</p>

<p>Then they went back to the house, carrying the huge yellow fruit
with them.</p>

<p>The girls went into the house, to see mother make pumpkin pies.</p>

<p>Mother cut open the yellow pumpkin. Oh, how thick the meat was! Oh,
how the fat, white seeds came tumbling out! Mother said the flesh was
good because it had a nice fine grain.</p>

<p>Mother cut the flesh into small pieces, after she had peeled off the
thick rind.</p>

<p>Then she put the pieces into a large iron pot to boil.</p>

<p>When the girls had seen the pieces disappear into the pot they went
to see what the boys were doing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37"
id="Page_37">[37]</a></span></p>

<p>Out by the barn they found the boys with a jack-knife, working away
at the other pumpkin. The boys were making a Jack-o&#8217;-lantern.</p>

<p>They had cut a round hole in the top of the pumpkin, so as to leave
the stem for a handle. In this way they could lift out the round piece
like a cover. They dug out all the seeds with their hands, to make it
hollow.</p>

<p>Then they cut a small hole, shaped like a triangle, in the side of
the pumpkin. They bored two round holes, one each side of the triangle.
Below it they cut a funny hole shaped like a new moon.</p>

<p>It looked like a huge grinning face. When the boys had finished it,
they put the pumpkin away in the barn.</p>

<p>Then they all remembered about the pumpkin that was cooking in the
kitchen, so they ran back to the house as fast as they could.</p>

<p>By this time the pumpkin in the pot was done, and mother took it
from the stove. She poured off the water, and then put the cooked
pumpkin into a colander.</p>

<p>While mother was rubbing the soft pumpkin through the colander, the
boys ran off to hunt for eggs. When they came back, mother took eight
of the eggs, and about three pints of the soft pumpkin. She stirred it
very fast, while the children stood around and watched, with open eyes
and mouths. Then she put in milk, and spice, and brown sugar.</p>

<p>Oh, didn&#8217;t it look good! The children smacked their lips as
each separate thing went in. Mother gave it all such a beating with her
big spoon that the children said it would be good ever after.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38"
id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>

<p>Next came the pie tins lined with soft crust, and last of all the
pies went into the oven.</p>

<p>That night as father and mother sat in front of the fire-place
talking, a strange noise was heard. What could it be? Was it a groan?
Was somebody hurt? There it was again, again, and again! It came from
the front porch.</p>

<p>Father went to the window and drew aside the curtain. Then they saw
something that made the smaller children shiver, but the older girls
only laughed. The boys were not in the house.</p>

<p>There at the window, staring in and grinning
horribly&mdash;was&mdash;well, what do you suppose? Yes it was the
Jack-o&#8217;-lantern.</p>

<h4>FOURTH WEEK</h4>

<h5>Monday</h5>

<p>Tell this story to the children:</p>

<p class="center">JACK FROST AND THE NUTS</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Little Miss Chestnut and her two sisters lived up in a tree in a
prickly green house. The house was as soft as velvet inside, but sharp
spikes on the outside kept away the squirrels, who would have torn down
the house if they could.</p>

<p>But soon Jack Frost came along. Jack does not mind fences, so he
knocked at the door of the Chestnut house.</p>

<p>&#8220;Little Miss Chestnut,&#8221; he called, &#8220;are you ready
to come out?&#8221;</p>

<p>But little Miss Chestnut replied, &#8220;I am not quite ready yet,
Mr. Jack.&#8221;</p>

<p>So Jack went off to the house where Miss Hickory<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span> Nut
lived. Miss Hickory Nut lived all alone in a round green cottage.</p>

<p>&#8220;Miss Hickory Nut,&#8221; he called &#8220;are you ready to
come out?&#8221;</p>

<p>But Miss Hickory Nut replied, &#8220;I am not quite ready yet, Mr.
Jack.&#8221;</p>

<p>So Jack went off to the low bush where Miss Hazel Nut lived in a
soft green tent. Miss Hazel Nut was already peeping out.</p>

<p>&#8220;Miss Hazel Nut,&#8221; he called, &#8220;are you ready to
come out?&#8221;</p>

<p>And little Miss Hazel Nut replied, &#8220;I am quite ready, Mr.
Jack.&#8221;</p>

<p>So she dropped down and waited below the bush, while Jack went back
after the other nuts.</p>

<p>Jack knocked once more at the chestnut house. Little Miss Chestnut
opened the door so quickly that she and her sisters fell to the
ground.</p>

<p>Then Jack knocked once more at the hickory house.</p>

<p>Miss Hickory Nut opened the door so quickly that her house fell
apart.</p>

<p>And all the other nut houses opened, and all the nuts came out to
see what was the matter.</p>

<p>The next day the children went for a walk. As they walked in the
woods they spied the nuts.</p>

<p>&#8220;See,&#8221; they said, &#8220;the frost has opened
the chestnut burrs, and all the other nuts must be out of the
shucks.&#8221;</p></div>

<h4>FOURTH WEEK</h4>

<h5>Monday</h5>

<p>The vegetables on the Thanksgiving table. The bread. The fruit. The
nuts.</p>

<h5>Tuesday</h5>

<p>Here is a simple version of the Thanksgiving story, to tell to the
children, in its proper place in connection with the lessons of the
month.</p>

<p class="center">THE THANKSGIVING STORY</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Once upon a time, some of the people of England were in great
trouble. The king would not allow them to worship God in the way they
thought right.</p>

<p>When they said they must do what they thought right, some of them
were whipped, and some of them were put in prison.</p>

<p>At last they decided to leave England, and go to some other country.
And they did go, in a ship, to a land where everybody dressed so
differently, and spoke such a different language that the English boys
and girls could not at first understand them. Holland was the name of
the country. How many of you have seen pictures of the Dutch children,
who live in Holland? How many of you have seen pictures of Dutch
windmills?</p>

<p>Now in Holland, in the course of time, the Dutch and the English
children became very good friends. Before very long the English
boys and girls were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65"
id="Page_65">[65]</a></span> talking Dutch as easily as if they had
been born in Holland, and had never heard of any other country.</p>

<p>&#8220;My, my,&#8221; said good Father Brewster, the
leader of the Puritans, as they were called. &#8220;This will never
do. We want our children to talk English, and to love England and her
ways&#8221;&mdash;for the Puritans still loved their country and their
flag, just as we love our beautiful flag with the stars and stripes.</p>

<p>&#8220;They say,&#8221; said Father Brewster,
&#8220;that far away over the ocean there is a land called America.
Let us go to America. There we can build houses like those we had in
England, and there our children can be brought up as English people.
Yes, we will go to America.&#8221;</p>

<p>So the Puritans engaged two big ships, and started to sail from
Holland to America. But one of the ships was too old and too worn out
to cross the ocean, so all the people embarked on the other ship and
sailed away.</p>

<p>The ship was called the <cite>Mayflower</cite>.</p>

<p>The <cite>Mayflower</cite> was crowded, and it rocked so that the boys and
girls became very tired. They wished they could get off and play on
land once more.</p>

<p>But two beautiful presents came to interest and amuse them on the
long voyage. And what do you think they were? Two little babies. One of
them was named Peregrine White. The other was named Oceanus Hopkins,
because he was born on the ocean.</p>

<p>One morning the children looked far away across the water, and they
could see a dark line. It was the land&mdash;<em>America</em>.</p>

<p>The next day the sails of the ship were taken down, and the
anchor was dropped in a little bay. Then<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span> some of the men climbed
down from the ship into a small boat, and rowed to the shore to see
what the place was like. In a little while they came back and called
out, &#8220;Come, we will take you all ashore.&#8221;</p>

<p>Such a scurrying and hurrying as there was then! Back and forth the
little boat went, until all the boys and girls, and men and women were
on the shore.</p>

<p>It was a very cold day, the twenty-second of December, 1620. But
they did not mind the cold.</p>

<p>In a little time the men had built some log houses, and soon there
was a church. The black rock on which the Pilgrims first stepped can be
seen to-day. It is called Plymouth Rock. The first girl to step upon
Plymouth rock was Mary Chilton.</p>

<p>One day a visitor came to see the Pilgrims. He was an Indian. He had
long, black hair. He was dressed in deerskin. He had a bow and arrows,
to shoot birds and deer with.</p>

<p>The Indian was very glad to see the white people. &#8220;Welcome,
Englishmen,&#8221; he said. He stayed over night with the Pilgrims, and
the next morning went away.</p>

<p>Soon he came back, bringing some friends with him.</p>

<p>When spring came, the Indians showed the Pilgrims how to catch eels,
and where to find fish. They also gave the Pilgrims corn to plant. They
showed them how to plant the corn, putting a fish in each hill to make
the corn grow well.</p>

<p>All summer long the boys and girls played around the log-houses, and
were very happy. There were beautiful wild-flowers, and bright-colored
song-birds in the woods where they played. One flower that blossomed
in the early spring they named the Mayflower,<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span> for the ship in which they
had come. The trailing arbutus has been called the Mayflower to this
day.</p>

<p>When the summer was ended, and all the corn and wheat were gathered
in, the Pilgrims said, &#8220;Let us have Thanksgiving Day. We will
thank God because he made the sun to shine, and the rain to fall, and
the corn to grow.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then the mothers said, &#8220;We will have a Thanksgiving party,
and invite the Indians. We will cook some of everything raised on the
farms.&#8221;</p>

<p>The men shot deer, and wild geese, and wild turkeys for the
dinner, and that is why we like to have roast goose or turkey for our
Thanksgiving dinner.</p>

<p>At last the Thanksgiving Day came. In the morning everybody went to
church. When they got home they found that all the Indians who had been
invited had come.</p>

<p>The Indians brought five large deer. The party lasted for three
days. At each meal, before they began to eat, the Pilgrims and the
Indians thanked God.</p>

<p>In the evening the Indians sang and danced, and in the daytime they
played games with the children.</p>

<p>At last the party was over. When the Indians were going home the
Pilgrims said, &#8220;Every year we shall have a time to thank God for
all He has done for us. You must come and help us thank Him.&#8221;</p>

<p>So every year the Pilgrims had their Thanksgiving Day. When other
people came to this country they said they would have Thanksgiving too.
So for nearly three hundred years we have had the glad Thanksgiving
Day. In what month does it come? On what day of November does it come
this year?</p>

<h5>Wednesday</h5>

<p>Fable for reproduction: The Fox and the Grapes. One day a hungry fox
started out to find something to eat. He saw some grapes, near the top
of a tall grapevine.</p>

<p>The fox tried to jump up and get the grapes but he could not reach
them. He tried again and again, but it was of no use.</p>

is to play the part of the fox walk along and look up eagerly at the
bunch of grapes.</p>

<p>&#8220;What beautiful grapes!&#8221; he says. &#8220;I
wish I had some.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then he jumps and tries to reach them. He tries a second time, and
a third. The last time he loses his balance and falls to the floor. He
gets up, rubs his head, and says, &#8220;I do not care for the grapes.
They are sour.&#8221;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Once upon a time the porcupine was made chief of the animals. He
called all the animals together for a great council.</p>

<p>The animals seated themselves around a big fire. The porcupine said,
&#8220;We have a great question to decide. It is this: &#8216;Shall we
have daylight all the time or night all the time?&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>All the animals began to talk at once. Some wanted one thing, some
another. The bear wanted it to be dark all the time. In his big, deep
voice he said, &#8220;Always night! Always night!&#8221;</p>

<p>The little chipmunk, in a loud, high voice, said, &#8220;Day will
come! Day will come!&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78"
id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>

<p>The council was held at night. While the animals were talking the
sun rose. The bear and the other night animals were angry. The chipmunk
saw the light coming, and started to run away. The angry bear ran after
him and struck him on the back with his paw.</p>

<p>Since then, the chipmunk has always had black stripes on his back,
and daylight always follows night.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The snowflakes were told to go down to the earth to keep it warm.
All were glad to go except one. This little snowflake grumbled while
the others were getting ready.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is the use of going down to that great
place?&#8221; he said. &#8220;I should be glad to keep the plants from
freezing, but I never can. I am too small. I could not even cover one
speck of that great earth. However, if all the rest of the snowflakes
are going, I suppose I shall have to go, too.&#8221;</p>

<p>The snowflakes had great fun as they fell. They danced and played,
and they laughed when they thought they were going to be useful in the
great world.</p>

<p>But the grumbling snowflake said, &#8220;If I were bigger, I might
be of some use!&#8221;</p>

<p>One little snowflake reached the earth, and then another. Last of
all, the grumbling snowflake came down, too, but he did not see the
brown earth. It was all covered with a white snow-blanket.</p>

<p>Every little flake had covered a tiny bit of the brown earth, until
the ground was all covered up for the winter.</p>

<p>Story, to be told to the children, and retold by them:</p>

<p class="center">THE WOODPECKER</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>An old lady lived on a hill.</p>

<p>She was very small, and she always wore a black dress and a large
white apron with big bows behind.</p>

<p>On her head she wore the queerest little red bonnet that you ever
saw.</p>

<p>The little old lady grew very selfish as the years went by. People
said this was because she thought of no one but herself.</p>

<p>One morning as she was baking cakes, a tired, hungry old man came up
to her door.</p>

<p>&#8220;My good woman,&#8221; said he, &#8220;will you
give me one of your cakes? I am very hungry. I have no money, but
whatever you first wish for you shall have.&#8221;</p>

<p>The old lady looked at her cakes and thought that they were too
large to give away. So she broke off a small bit of dough and put it
into the oven to bake.</p>

<p>When it was done she thought that this one was too nice and
brown for a beggar. So she baked a smaller<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span> cake, and then a still
smaller one, but each came out of the oven as nice and as brown as the
first.</p>

<p>At last she took a piece of dough as small as the head of a pin.
Even this, when it was baked, was as large and as fine as the others.
So the old lady put all the cakes on the shelf and offered the old man
a crust of dry bread.</p>

<p>The old man only looked at her, and before the old lady could wink,
he was gone.</p>

<p>The old lady thought a great deal about what she had done. She knew
it was very wrong.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish I were a bird,&#8221; she said; &#8220;I
would fly to him with the largest cake I have.&#8221;</p>

<p>As she spoke, she felt herself growing smaller and smaller. Suddenly
the wind picked her up and carried her up the chimney.</p>

<p>When she came out she still had on her red bonnet and black dress.
You could see her white apron with the big bows. But she was a bird,
just as she had wished to be.</p>

<p>She was a wise bird, and at once she began to pick her food out of
the hard wood of a tree. As people saw her at work, they called her the
red-headed woodpecker.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Baby Bunting was ten months old before she had a Christmas. When the
first Christmas came, she didn&#8217;t know what it meant. When she
saw the tree all covered with candles and apples and little baskets
of candy, she smiled, and then laughed, and then crowed out loud. She
shook her fat hands at the pretty sight, while Father and Mother and
Sister Nora danced around her baby carriage.</p>

<p>Then they began to take the presents off the tree. There was a fine
clock for Mother and a pair of slippers for Father. Sister Nora had a
beautiful doll.</p>

<p>Baby Bunting herself had a warm little muff, some dainty socks, a
pair of baby shoes, some picture books, and so many presents besides
that it would take too long to tell about them all.</p>

<p>Sister Nora was happy with her big wax doll. She named her Sally
Bunting, and brought her to the carriage to make a call on her sister
Baby Bunting.</p>

<p>Baby was so pleased at this, that she almost talked. It seemed to
Nora as if she really did talk to Sally. Perhaps Sally, the baby doll,
could hear this talk better than anyone else.</p>

<p>Story for reproduction:</p>

<p class="center">A CLOUD STORY</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>A long time ago, there lived a wonderful king. Each day this king
came in his golden chariot, bringing light, heat, and happiness to all
the people.</p>

<p>Each day he passed from his palace in the east to his throne in the
west. He never missed a day, for he wanted to make sure that everyone
had a share of his gifts.</p>

<p>For everybody, he had the birds sing and the flowers bloom. For
everybody, he showed beautiful pictures, which changed every hour.</p>

<p>The king had many beautiful daughters. They were often called swan
maidens, because they rode upon beautiful white swans.</p>

<p>When the swan maidens were with their father they wore soft white or
gray dresses.</p>

<p>Sometimes the king saw that the grass was brown, or the buds were
not coming out. Then he said, &#8220;Swan maidens, who will go and work
to-day?&#8221;</p>

<p>Almost before he was through speaking, many of them had rushed away.
Sometimes more of them came than could work upon the grass and buds.</p>

<p>Then some of them ran off to play. But the best of them went down to
feed the roots and the worms. They worked out of sight.</p>

<p>But they always went back to their father, the king.</p>

<p>Now it is very hard work to catch a swan maiden on her way back
home.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109"
id="Page_109">[109]</a></span></p>

<p>A boy is sure he saw one of them on a ring in the tea-kettle steam.
How many of them get away is a secret.</p>

<p>When the king saw the flowers shiver in the fall, he called the
bravest swan maidens to him. He told them that they must go away for a
long time.</p>

<p>Then each swan maiden put on a beautiful white dress, and came
softly down, down to earth, with a warm blanket.</p>

<p>These blankets they spread over the flowers and seeds. Every little
flower went to sleep under the blanket.</p>

<p>At last the king smiled, and their work was done. They slipped away
home so softly that nobody missed them, but the boys and girls who
loved the snow.</p>

<p class="center">THE ROBIN&#8217;S RED BREAST</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Long ago, in the far north, where it is very cold, there was only
one fire.</p>

<p>An old man and his little son took care of this fire and kept it
burning day and night.</p>

<p>They knew that if the fire went out all the people would freeze and
that the white bear would have the northland all to himself.</p>

<p>But one day the old man became very sick so that his son had
everything to do.</p>

<p>For many days and nights he bravely took care of his father and kept
the fire burning.</p>

<p>But at last he got so tired and sleepy that he could no longer
work.</p>

<p>Now the white bear was always watching the fire.</p>

<p>He longed for the time when he would have the northland all to
himself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149"
id="Page_149">[149]</a></span></p>

<p>And when he saw how tired and sleepy the little boy was, he stayed
close to the fire and laughed to himself.</p>

<p>One night the poor little boy could endure no longer and fell fast
asleep.</p>

<p>Then the white bear ran as fast as he could and jumped upon the fire
with his wet feet and rolled upon it.</p>

<p>At last he thought it was all out and went happily away to his
cave.</p>

<p>But a gray robin was flying near and saw what the white bear was
doing.</p>

<p>She waited until the bear went away.</p>

<p>Then she flew down and searched with her sharp little eyes until she
found a tiny live spark.</p>

<p>This she fanned patiently for a long time with her wings.</p>

<p>Her little breast was scorched red, but she did not give up.</p>

<p>After awhile a fine red blaze sprang up again.</p>

<p>Then she flew away to every hut in the northland.</p>

<p>And everywhere that she touched the ground a fire began to burn.</p>

<p>So that soon instead of one little fire the whole northland was
lighted up.</p>

<p>And now all that the white bear could do was to go farther back into
his cave and growl.</p>

<p>For now, indeed, he knew that the northland was not all for him.</p>

<p>And this is the reason why the people in the north country love the
robin. And they are never tired of telling their children how it got
its red breast.</p></div>

<p>When the children were old enough, they went out into the world to
work. Often they were gone all day long.</p>

<p>They had to sweep and dust the whole world. They carried water from
the sea to wash and scrub the earth.</p>

<p>It was spring.</p>

<p>The sun had melted the snow from the hill-tops; the grass blades
were pushing their way through the brown earth, and the buds on the
trees were beginning to break open and let the tiny green leaves peep
out.</p>

<p>A bee, waked from the sleep in which he had lain all through the
winter, rubbed his eyes, then opened the door, and looked out to see if
the ice and snow and the north wind had gone away. Yes; there was warm,
clear sunshine.</p>

<p>He slipped out of the hive, stretched his wings and flew away.</p>

<p>He went to the apple tree and asked, &#8220;Have you anything for a
hungry bee, who has eaten nothing the whole winter long?&#8221;</p>

<p>The apple tree answered:</p>

<p>&#8220;No; you have come too early. My blossoms
are still buds and so I have nothing for you. Go to the cherry
tree.&#8221;</p>

<p>He flew to the cherry tree and said, &#8220;Dear cherry tree, have
you any honey for a hungry bee?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Come again to-morrow; to-day my blossoms are
shut up, but when they are open you are welcome to them.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then he flew to a bed of tulips nearby. They had large, beautiful
flowers, but there was neither sweetness nor perfume in them and he
could not find any honey.</p>

<p>Tired and hungry, the poor bee turned to seek his home, when a tiny
dark blue flower, beside a hedge, caught his eye.</p>

<p>It was a violet that was all ready for the bee&#8217;s coming. The
violet opened its cup of sweetness. The bee drank his fill, and carried
some honey to the hive.</p>

<p>Story to be told to the children:</p>

<p class="center">THE MORNING-GLORY SEED</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>A little girl dropped a morning-glory seed into a small hole in the
ground. As she did so she said, &#8220;Now, morning-glory seed, hurry
and grow, grow, grow, until you are a tall vine, covered with pretty
green leaves and lovely trumpet flowers.&#8221;</p>

<p>But the earth was very dry. There had been no rain for a long time,
and the poor seed could not grow at all.</p>

<p>After it had lain in the ground for nine long days and nine long
nights, the little seed said to the ground, &#8220;Oh, ground, please
give me a few drops of water to soften<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span> my hard brown coat. Then
my coat can burst open and set free my two green seed-leaves, and then
I can begin to be a vine.&#8221;</p>

<p>But the ground said, &#8220;You must ask that of the rain.&#8221;</p>

<p>So the seed called to the rain. &#8220;Oh, rain,&#8221; it said,
&#8220;please come down and wet the ground around me, so that it may
give me a few drops of water, to soften my hard brown coat. Then my
coat can burst open and set free my two green seed-leaves, and then I
can begin to be a vine.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I cannot,&#8221; said the rain, &#8220;unless
the clouds hang low.&#8221;</p>

<p>So the seed said to the clouds, &#8220;Oh, clouds, please hang low,
and let the rain come down and wet the ground around me, so that it may
give me a few drops of water to soften my hard brown coat. Then my coat
can burst open and set free my two green seed-leaves, and then I can
begin to be a vine.&#8221;</p>

<p>But the clouds said, &#8220;The sun must hide first.&#8221;</p>

<p>So the seed called to the sun. &#8220;Oh, sun, please hide for a
little while. Then the clouds can hang low, and let the rain come
down and wet the ground around me, so that it may give me a few drops
of water, to soften my hard brown coat. Then my coat can burst open
and set free my two green seed-leaves, and then I can begin to be a
vine.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I will,&#8221; said the sun, and he hid at
once.</p>

<p>Then the clouds hung low and lower. The rain began to fall fast
and faster. The ground began to grow wet and wetter. The seed-coat
began to grow soft and softer, until it burst open. Out came two
bright green seed-leaves, and the morning-glory seed began to be a
vine.&mdash;<i>Adapted</i></p>

rubber?</p>

<p class="center">THE RAINBOW FAIRIES</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>One night three little fairies were playing under a tree. They were
flower fairies. Each had on a dress of the same color as the flower for
which it was named. Little Fairy Buttercup wore a bright yellow dress.
Forget-me-not wore a blue dress. Geranium wore a red dress.</p>

<p>Not far from the three fairies in red, yellow and blue, were three
other fairies. These fairies had on old, faded dresses. They stood and
watched the gaily-dressed fairies dance in the moonlight.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come,&#8221; said Buttercup, &#8220;won&#8217;t you come and
dance with us?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We cannot,&#8221; said the three. &#8220;We cannot dance,
for we have on our old clothes. We have worked hard all day and
are just going home, but we like to see you dance in your pretty
clothes.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198"
id="Page_198">[198]</a></span></p>

<p>Then Buttercup took the skirt of her yellow dress and dipped it into
a lily cup filled with dew. The dew was quickly dyed yellow.</p>

<p>Forget-me-not dipped the skirt of her blue dress into another lily
cup filled with dew. The dew was quickly dyed blue. Then the fairies
mixed the yellow dew and the blue dew together.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now jump in, little fairy,&#8221; cried
Buttercup. In jumped one of the fairies in faded gown, and when she
came out her dress was a beautiful green.</p>

<p>Then Geranium dipped her dress into dew, and Forget-me-not did the
same. They mixed blue and red, and the second fairy jumped in. When she
came out, her dress was bright purple.</p>

<p>Then Buttercup and Geranium dipped their dresses into dew again, to
make a mixture for the third fairy. When she came out of the lily cup
her dress was bright orange.</p>

<p>Then the six fairies laughed and sang, and danced about. By and by a
dark cloud covered the moon, and the rain came pattering down. The six
fairies hid themselves in the flowers.</p>

<p>The next morning, when the rain stopped, the sun came out and shone
brightly. The six fairies came out of the flowers, and hand in hand
they ran up to the sky. There they made a beautiful rainbow. Since
then, they have been called the Rainbow Fairies.&mdash;<i>Adapted</i></p>

<p>Story for reproduction:</p>

<p class="center">ANEMONE</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Once upon a time there lived a youth whose name was Adonis. He
was a fine-looking boy, tall and straight, and he was very fond of
hunting.</p>

<p>Every day, with only his dogs for company, he would go into the
woods, carrying his bow and arrows. He had a fast horse on which he
rode.</p>

<p>His friends often urged him not to go too far into the deep woods,
but Adonis was not at all afraid. He had killed bears, and he had
killed lions, so why should he be afraid?</p>

<p>One day Adonis was in the woods as usual, when he caught sight
of two wild hogs. He left his dogs to worry one of the hogs, and he
started after the other with his spear.</p>

<p>The angry hog bit him and he had to hasten to the brook to bathe his
wounds. The angry hog followed him.</p>

<p>Swimming in the brook were some beautiful white swans. When they saw
Adonis wounded, they went to Venus and told her what they had seen.</p>

<p>Venus hastened to the brook in her silver chariot.</p>

<p class="dbqt">&#8220;Adonis! Adonis!&#8221; she cried.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212"
id="Page_212">[212]</a></span></p>

<p>No answer came. The only trace she could find of Adonis was some
drops of blood on the green grass.</p>

<p>Venus was very sorry, for she loved the boy Adonis very much. From
a silver cup which she carried with her, she sprinkled a few drops of
blood over the grass. In a little while, tiny flower buds peeped out
from the spot where each drop of blood had fallen.</p>

<p>A gentle wind came up and blew the little buds open and before
night it had blown them all away. People called the little flowers
wind-flowers, or anemones. Their delicate pink coloring was believed
to have come from the heart of Adonis. Have you seen the dainty little
anemones, the wind-flowers?&mdash;<i>Adapted</i></p></div>

we move our eyes? What are some of the sounds you have heard this
morning?</p>

<h4>FOURTH WEEK</h4>

<h5>Monday</h5>

<p>Have the children close their eyes. Place on each tongue a bit of
salt. How many know what it was? Do the same with a bit of sugar, a bit
of vinegar, a bit of nutmeg.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218"
id="Page_218">[218]</a></span></p>

<h5>Tuesday</h5>

<p>Conversation on Taste:</p>

<p>How do we taste? What have we in the mouth that helps us to taste?
(Tongue.) What becomes of what we eat after it has been chewed? Do we
taste food after it has been swallowed?</p>

<p>(Have the children test this by actual experiment, with an apple,
or some other eatable with pronounced taste.) Tell the children about
the taste-buds on the tongue that help us to tell the flavor of what we
take into the mouth.</p>

<h5>Wednesday</h5>

<p>Have the children close their eyes. Allow each child to smell
cologne, vinegar, a lemon, and an onion. How many can tell by the scent
what each is?</p>

<h5>Thursday</h5>

<p>Conversation on Smelling:</p>

<p>With what do we smell? Can we smell anything if we cover the nose?
Why is it difficult to smell anything if one has a cold? Which has the
keener sense of smell, you or a dog? Can a horse smell? A cow? A cat?
How does a cat know when a mouse is near?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219"
id="Page_219">[219]</a></span></p>

<h5>Friday</h5>

<p>Have the children close their eyes. Allow each child to feel a
soft ball, a marble, a handkerchief, and a piece of crayon. How many
can guess, by the feeling, what the objects are? How do we know, by
feeling, whether an article is hard or soft? What part of the hand has
the most sensitive sense of touch? How does a cat know if we pull her
tail? How do you know when a pin pricks you? How does a dog know when a
flea is biting him?</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site

to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means

full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty

  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project

from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
